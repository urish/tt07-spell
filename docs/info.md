## How it works

SPELL is a minimal, stack-based programming language created for [The Skull CTF](https://skullctf.com).

The language is defined by the following [cryptic piece of Arduino code](https://skullctf.com/spell):

```c
void spell() {

                  uint8_t*a,pc=16,sp=0,
               s[32]={0},op;while(!0){op=
            EEPROM.read(pc);switch(+op){case
          ',':delay(s[sp-1]);sp--;break;case'>':
         s[sp-1]>>=1|1;break;case'<':s[sp-1]<<=1;
        break;case'=':pc=s[sp-1]-1;sp--;break;case
       '@':if(s[sp-2]){s[sp-2]--;pc=s[sp-1]-1;sp+=
      1;}sp-=2;break;case'&':s[sp-2]&=s[sp-1];sp-=1;
      break;case'|':s[sp-2]|=s[sp-1];sp-=1;break;case
    '^':s[sp-2]^=s[sp-1];sp--;break;case'+':s[sp-2]+=
   s[sp-1];sp=sp-1;break;case'-':s[sp-2]-=s[sp-1];sp--;
   break;case'2':s[sp]=s[sp-1];sp=sp+1;break;case'?':s[
 sp-1]=EEPROM.         read(s[sp-1]|0        );break;case
  "!!!"[0]:             666,EEPROM              .write(s
   [sp-1]                ,s[sp-2]                );sp=+
    sp-02;               ;break;                 1;case
    "Arr"[               1]:  s[+               sp-1]=
    *(char*)            (s[+   sp-1           ]);break
      ;case'w':*   (char*)(     s[+sp-1])  =s[sp-+2];
        sp-=2;break;case+       'x':s[sp] =s[sp-1
           ];s[sp-1]=s[sp   +    -2];s[sp-2]=s[
            0|sp];break;    ;;    case"zzz"[0
             ]:sleep();"   Arrr  ";break;case
             255  :return;;  default:s  [sp]
              =+   op;sp+=    1,1   ;}pc=
               +    pc  +      1;      %>

}
```

This design is an hardware implementation of SPELL with the following features:

- 32 bytes of internal program memory (volatile, simulates EEPROM)
- 32 bytes of stack memory
- 8 bytes of internal RAM
- External SPI memory interface (optional)

To load a program or inspect the internal state, the design provides access to the following registers via a simple serial interface:

| Address | Register name | Description                                        |
|---------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 0x00    | PC            | Program counter                                    |
| 0x01    | SP            | Stack pointer                                      |
| 0x02    | EXEC          | Execute-in-place (write-only)                      |
| 0x03    | STACK         | Stack access (read the top value, or push a value) |

The serial interface is implemented using a shift register, which is controlled by the following signals:

| Pin         | Type   | Description                                                       |
|-------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `reg_sel`   | input  | Select the register to read/write                                 |
| `load`      | input  | Load the selected register with the value from the shift register |
| `dump`      | input  | Dump the selected register value to the shift register            |
| `shift_in`  | input  | Serial data input                                                 |
| `shift_out` | output | Serial data output                                                |

When `load` is high, the value from the shift register is loaded into the selected register. When `dump` is high, the value of the selected register is dumped into the shift register, and can be read after two clock cycles by reading `shift_out` (MSB first).

For example, if you want to read the value of the program counter, you would:

1. Set `reg_sel` to 0x00 and set `dump` to 1
3. Wait for two clock cycles for the first bit (MSB) to appear on `shift_out`.
4. Read the remaining bits from `shift_out` on each clock cycle.

To write a value to the program counter, you would:

1. Write the value to the shift register, one bit at a time, starting with the **MSB**.
2. Set `reg_sel` to 0x00 and set `load` to 1.
3. Wait for a single clock cycle for the value to be loaded.

Writing an opcode to the `EXEC` register will execute the opcode in place, without modifying the program counter (unless the opcode is a jump instruction).

The `STACK` register is used to push a value onto the stack or read the top value from the stack (for debugging purposes).

## How to test

To test SPELL, you need to load a program into the program memory and execute it. You can load the program by repeatedly executing the following steps for each byte of the program:

1. Write the byte to the top of the stack (using the `STACK` register)
2. Write the address of the byte in the program memory to top of the stack
3. Write the opcode `!` to the `EXEC` register

After loading the program, you can execute it by writing the address of the first byte in the program memory to the `PC` register, and then pulsing the `run` signal.

### Test program

The following program which will rapidly blink an LED connected to the `uio[0]` pin. The program bytes should be loaded into the program memory starting at address 0:

```python
[1, 56, 119, 250, 44, 1, 54, 119, 250, 44, 3, 61]
```

## External hardware

You can connect an external 23LC512 SPI memory to the project. The MISO signal determines whether the design will use the external memory: pull it high (10k resistor to VDD) to use the external memory, or pull it low (10k resistor to GND) to use the internal memory.

When using the external memory, the program will have access to 256 bytes of code memory, and 192 bytes of data memory (as the addresses 0x20 through 0x5f are mapped to the I/O registers).
